# Integrate Genesys Cloud with an HRIS system to sync time-off requests and time-off balances from Genesys Cloud WFM

This Genesys Cloud Developer Blueprint integrates Genesys Cloud with an HRIS to retrieve employee time-off balances and provide that information in Genesys Cloud workforce management. When a time-off request is created or updated in Genesys Cloud workforce management, the integration inserts the request to the HRIS for tracking and verification against the employee's available balance.
